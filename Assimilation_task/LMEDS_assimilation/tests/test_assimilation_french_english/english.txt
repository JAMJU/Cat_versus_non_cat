====================

Here is a list of reference words that contain all the English vowel sounds that you will need to familiarize yourself with for this experiment.
Every vowel sound is in bold in the reference words below. Click on the buttons to listen to the words. Please, take the time to differentiate between all these vowel sounds.
You can listen to the words multiple times. Once you have listened to all of them, click on 'Done'.
You will be asked to listen to these words again throughout the experiment.

====================
training_exp_inst
====================

In this experiment, we are going to ask you to listen to syllables. For example, you might hear the syllable “pap.”
These syllables will come from languages other than English. For each syllable, we are going to ask you which English vowel sound, out of the sounds you just identified,
is the most similar to its central vowel sound. In the example of “pap”, you would likely click on “trap”, in order to indicate that the most similar sound is the “a” sound in “trap". <br /><br />

Next, you will have to indicate if the vowel sound you heard in the syllable would be considered a good example of the English vowel you selected, or whether it would sound unusual if you heard someone pronounce the sound in that way. <br /><br />

We are going to train you on a few examples, and then you will begin the experiment.  (press [space] to continue)


====================
alerte
====================

The way people pronounce English differs depending on where they are from and how old they are. There may be options that don't correspond to
a sound that you would ever use in your own speech. You may also find there are options missing. Choose the option that seems the most reasonable.

====================

Unlike the syllables that you will hear in the real experiment, this syllable was pronounced by an English speaker.
The speaker has a typical American English pronunciation, and you would most likely have indicated that it was a Typical or Fairly typical example of the vowel sound in the word ‘l<b>oo</b>p’.

====================
training_exp_ext
====================

You just heard a syllable with a vowel sound typical of a language other than English. Here, you should follow your instinct, in order to choose the most similar English vowel sound.
You would likely indicate that it was not a Typical or Fairly typical example of this vowel sound. (press [space] to continue)

====================
before_exp
====================

You can now start the experiment. <br /><br />

You will do the same task you were just trained on.
The audio examples have been extracted from continuous speech, and you may sometimes hear a very small part of the surrounding context.
For example, you may hear  'ipap' or ‘papuh’,  instead of just 'pap'. Focus on the central vowel of the main syllable (the 'a' in our example).
 <br /><br />
There will be multiple breaks, and we will be ensuring that you are paying attention. Before the real start of the experiment, you will have to hear all the reference words once again. (press [space] to continue)

<b>2)</b> Please <b>wear headphones or earbuds</b> when listening to audio files.
<br /><br />

<b>3)</b> <b>You should be in a quiet room</b>, free from distraction for the duration of the experiment.  If there is significant background noise, such as in a cafe or other public area, you may have trouble listening to audio files and concentrating on the experiment.
<br /><br />

<b>4)</b> Please <b>silence or turn off your cell-phone</b> and other noise-making electronics.
<br /><br />

<b>5)</b> Please <b>close all other browser windows or tabs</b>--particularly those that issue auditory or visual alerts or status updates such as email providers or social networking websites.

====================
feedbacks
====================

The experiment in which you just participated aims to understand how human beings perceive speech, and
learn to perceive speech, in their native language. It is well known that languages differ from one another in
the sounds (consonant and vowel sounds) that they use to make words. For example, in English, the ​ ee ​ sound
and the ​ ih sound are two different speech sounds, which can be used to make different words (​ feet versus fit ) ​ .
In many other languages, this is not the case. In Spanish, for example, there is an ​ ee s ​ ound (written ​ i, as in
señorita), but there is no distinct ​ ih sound (thus, although the Spanish word ​ chili ​ has been adapted into
English as ​ chih-lee, ​ the Spanish pronunciation is chee-lee). It is also well known that human beings perceive
differences in speech sounds much better when these differences are used in the language or languages to
which they had early exposure during infancy and childhood, and have difficulties hearing the differences
between sounds which are not used in their language(s). This is a major reason for which people learning
second languages later in life tend to have "foreign accents" when they speak.<br /><br />
This study aims to understand the cognitive brain mechanisms by which human beings perceive and learn the
sounds of their language. By aggregating the results of many experimental participants in artificial
experiments which simulate some aspect of speech perception or learning of sounds, and, in particular, by
examining which sounds, or which learning tasks, people find more difficult, we are able to test specific
hypotheses about the underlying cognitive mechanisms, which make specific predictions. By understanding
these cognitive mechanisms, we also hope to better understand why it is that all human languages have
certain things in common.<br /><br />
