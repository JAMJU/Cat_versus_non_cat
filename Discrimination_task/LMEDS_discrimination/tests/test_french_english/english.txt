====================

We have enough participants for this study. Thank you for your time!


====================
training_text
====================

You will hear three sounds one after the other. You will have to decide which of the first two sounds is more similar to the last one (the third sound).<br /><br />
 If you are sure that the first sound is closer to the last sound than the second is, you can click on 'first for sure' or press [f].<br /><br />
If you think it is the second sound, you can click on 'second for sure' or press [c]. <br /><br />
If you are unsure of your choice, you should use the other buttons ('first,
almost sure', 'second, almost sure', 'second, unsure', etc) <br /><br />
 (press [space] to continue)

====================
training_text_2
====================

On the next page, the sounds will
be noisy, and thus difficult to hear. Do not hesitate to use the buttons
'unsure' and 'almost sure'. Use your first instinct as to whether it is
the first or the second.

====================
audio_list_instructions
====================

Now you are trained, and
the study can begin. On the following pages you'll do new audio files,
with opportunities to take short breaks. <b>Try not to overthink this task.
Follow your instinct.</b> <br /><br />
This experiment has been set up to enable you to answer questions with your keyboard. Please follow the instructions.

====================
Welcome.
You have chosen to participate in our study.
<b> To be paid, you must do this study attentively and carefully. Please pay
attention to the stimuli and respond appropriately.
</b>
For each task, you will be presented with some 
instructions, please follow them carefully. 
You will have to answer to a pre survey about your language experience, and a post survey about your English pronunciation.<br /><br />

The whole study should last around 30min. <br /><br />
Thank you for your time.<br /><br />

a media choice page, as you have seen before.  However,
these pages have been configured to allow interaction via a keyboard.
Specific instructions will be given for each page.

training
====================

You will first be trained on the task we will ask you to perform during this experiment. On the next pages you'll listen to a list of audio files separated by a brief pause. This experiment has been set up to enable you to answer questions with your keyboard. Please follow the instructions.

====================

The following examples are like what you will hear during the rest of the experiment and they are noisy. (presser [espace] pour continuer)


====================
you_should_have_first_cat_dog_cat
====================

You just heard 'cat' 'dog', then 'cat' again. The last sound was closer to the first sound than to the second sound. <br /><br />We expect that you
would have pressed 'first for sure', or the [f] key. You might also
press the options 'first, almost sure' [g] or 'first, unsure' [h] for
cases where you are not very sure or feel you are just guessing.<br /><br />
 (press [space] to continue)
====================
you_should_have_second_dog_cat_cat
====================

You just heard 'dog', 'cat' and then 'cat' again. The last sound was closer to the second sound than to the second sound. <br /><br />We expect that you
would have pressed 'second for sure', or the [c] key. You might also
press the options 'second, almost sure' [v] or 'second, unsure' [b] for
cases where you are not very sure or feel you are just guessing.<br /><br /> (press [space] to continue)


====================
you_should_have_second_dog_cat_dog
====================

You just heard 'dog', 'cat', then 'dog' again. The last sound was closer to the first sound than to the second sound. <br /><br />We expect that you
would have pressed 'first for sure', or the [f] key. You might also
press the options 'first, almost sure' [g] or 'first, unsure' [h] for
cases where you are not very sure or feel you are just guessing.<br /><br /> (press [space] to continue)

====================
you_should_have_second_cat_dog_dog
====================

You just heard 'cat', 'dog' and then 'dog' again. The last sound was closer to the second sound than to the second sound. <br /><br />We expect that you
would have pressed 'second for sure', or the [c] key. You might also
press the options 'second, almost sure' [v] or 'second, unsure' [b] for
cases where you are not very sure or feel you are just guessing.<br /><br /> (press [space] to continue)

====================
you_should_have_other
====================

The right answer was the first sound, but, since the sounds
were noisy and that they are from another language than English, it was hard tell. In difficult cases, use the buttons
'almost sure' or 'not sure', and use your intuition as to whether it is
the first or second. Try not to overthink this task. Follow your instinct.<br /><br /> (press [space] to continue)

====================
you_should_have_easy_1
====================

The last sound was closer to the first sound than to the second sound. <br /><br />We expect that you
would have pressed 'first for sure', or the [f] key. You might also
press the options 'first, almost sure' [g] or 'first, unsure' [h] for
cases where you are not very sure or feel you are just guessing.<br /><br /> (press [space] to continue)

====================
you_should_have_easy_0
====================

The last sound was closer to the second sound than to the second sound. <br /><br />We expect that you
would have pressed 'second for sure', or the [c] key. You might also
press the options 'second, almost sure' [v] or 'second, unsure' [b] for
cases where you are not very sure or feel you are just guessing.<br /><br /> (press [space] to continue)

<br /><br />

<b>5)</b> Please <b>close all other browser windows or tabs</b>--particularly those that issue auditory or visual alerts or status updates such as email providers or social networking websites.

====================
feedbacks
====================

The experiment in which you just participated aims to understand how human beings perceive speech, and
learn to perceive speech, in their native language. It is well known that languages differ from one another in
the sounds (consonant and vowel sounds) that they use to make words. For example, in English, the ​ ee ​ sound
and the ​ ih sound are two different speech sounds, which can be used to make different words (​ feet versus fit ) ​ .
In many other languages, this is not the case. In Spanish, for example, there is an ​ ee s ​ ound (written ​ i, as in
señorita), but there is no distinct ​ ih sound (thus, although the Spanish word ​ chili ​ has been adapted into
English as ​ chih-lee, ​ the Spanish pronunciation is chee-lee). It is also well known that human beings perceive
differences in speech sounds much better when these differences are used in the language or languages to
which they had early exposure during infancy and childhood, and have difficulties hearing the differences
between sounds which are not used in their language(s). This is a major reason for which people learning
second languages later in life tend to have "foreign accents" when they speak.<br /><br />
This study aims to understand the cognitive brain mechanisms by which human beings perceive and learn the
sounds of their language. By aggregating the results of many experimental participants in artificial
experiments which simulate some aspect of speech perception or learning of sounds, and, in particular, by
examining which sounds, or which learning tasks, people find more difficult, we are able to test specific
hypotheses about the underlying cognitive mechanisms, which make specific predictions. By understanding
these cognitive mechanisms, we also hope to better understand why it is that all human languages have
certain things in common.<br /><br />
